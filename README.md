card counter
This is a react based web app that keeps count on all the card that have been dealt by the dealer.
once you deal yourself and the dealer cards you can calculate the odds for a win.
This software also tells you what should be your next move (Stand, Hit, Double).
The software works by calculating all the possibilities with the remaining deck but you have to tell the software your cards and the dealer's.
Also this app implements the old counting card by checking how many high and low cards have been dealt and telling you before the hand starts  if the deck is cold or warm.
